# Lemon Disease Detector

## Plan

So the plan is to create a `Convolutional Neural Network`, a `Multi-Class Classifier` that takes an image of Lemon Leaf and tells if the leaf is healthy or has any disease.

The possible diseases it should be able to tell apart are,
- Anthracnose
- Bacterial Blight
- Citrus Canker
- Curl Virus
- Deficiency Leaf
- Dry Leaf
- Sooty Mould
- Spider Mites
- (And also) Healthy Leaves

### Dataset

- [Lemon Leaf Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudshaheen1134/lemon-leaf-disease-dataset-lldd) on Kaggle
